# Baby_Names

Using a text file provided by the US Social Security Administration, the file contains popular baby names from each year by gender. The
program reads in the data, stores it in a dictionary and then allows the user to runs queries interactively. Queries include
showing the most popular name for a given year and gender, showing rank for a given name, gender, and year, and finding the year in which the given name and gender combination was the most popular. Additionally queries are not avaliable to the user, but have been developed and tested to demonstrate understanding of JUnit.
